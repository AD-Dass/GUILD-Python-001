    "3. Boolean - A variable representing 1 or 0. In most (including Python) these are True / False.\n",

It requires a lot of practise, studying, and a growth mindset to cope with learning new stuff constantly. The application of Python and other coding languages are vast and their is plenty of learning materials to help you along that journey.\n",

    "Though Python isn't the go to platform for most game developers, you can still create games in with some Python libraries before learning more complex languages such as C++. \n",

    "Data is the new oil! Business across the world need it to gain a competitive advantage by learning about themselves and their competitors. Data scientist help this by collecting data and analysing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pandas** - https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp - *Pandas' library allows you to analyse medium to large datasets.*\n",
