    "\n",
    "Becomming a game developler (and any kind of coder for that matter) doesn't happen overnight. It requires a lot of practise, studying, and a growth mindset to cope with learning new stuff constantly. The application of Python and other coding languages are vast and there is plenty of learning materials to help you along that journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've included some additional resources for those interested in learning more on additional topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **General**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. https://www.w3schools.com/python/\n",
    "2. https://docs.python.org/3/ (This is basically the user manual for Python.)\n",
    "3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw (Long video but goes from A-Z)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Game development**\n",
    "Though Python isn't the go to platform for most game developers, you can still create games in with some Python libraries before learning more complex languages such as C++. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PyGame** - https://www.pygame.org/wiki/tutorials (Official website for the Pygame library.)\n",
    "2. **PyGame** - https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/\n",
    "3. **PyGame** - https://realpython.com/tutorials/gamedev/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Data science**\n",
    "Data is the new oil! Business across the world need it to gain a competitive advantage by learning about themselves and their competitors. Data scientist help this by collecting data and analysing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pandas** - https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp - *Pandas' library allows you to analyse medium to large datasets.*\n",
    "2. **Learn Numpy** - https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_intro.asp - *Very important for game developers as well.*\n",
    "3. **Request / Selenium** - https://realpython.com/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/ - *Useful for data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Machine learning and AI**\n",
    "ML and AI can be quite maths heavy as well. Its a worth learning about statistics and regression analysis before diving into this.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SciKitLearn** - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ \n",
    "2. **PyTorch** - https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html\n",
    "3. **Tensorflow** - https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs\n",
    "4. **Spark** - https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/"
